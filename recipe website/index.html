                        <h4>What Is Velveting?</h4>
                        <p>Velveting means marinating uncooked meat in an alkaline mixture—typically, a cornstarch
                            slurry,
                            baking soda, or egg whites—to render it more tender. The marinade also acts as a protective
                            barrier,
                            absorbing extra moisture, to prevent the meat from drying out and becoming tough when
                            cooked.
                            <br>
                            Velveting is especially helpful when cooking with tough and fibrous cuts of meat (think:
                            beef,
                            chicken and turkey breasts, and pork) but can also be used on seafood like scallops and
                            shrimp
                            to
                            keep them from overcooking.
                            <br>
                            Though the technique originated in China, a lot of Thai cooking is influenced by the
                            Chinese, so
                            velveting is a staple at my family’s Thai restaurant and at home. It’s how we achieve tender
                            meats,
                            cooked to perfection in recipes like Pad See Ew and Pad Thai, as well as countless
                            stir-fries.
                        </p>

                        <h4>How Do You Velvet Meat?</h4>
                        <p>Velveting is a low-effort, high-reward technique for cooking beef, chicken, pork, and more.
                            Begin
                            by
                            slicing or dicing the meat against the grain. It doesn't matter how big or small as long as
                            they're
                            uniform in size.

                            Place the meat in a bowl and coat with either of the two velveting mixtures <below:br>
                            </below:br>

                            <br><b>1. Baking Soda</b> <br>

                            When velveting with baking soda, the proteins in the meat become denatured, resulting in a
                            dreamy
                            tenderness that you’ll never want to cook without. This is my grandmother’s go-to technique,
                            as
                            it
                            enhances the raw meat’s ability to hold onto moisture, preventing it from drying out while
                            it
                            cooks.

                            Sprinkle approximately 1 teaspoon of baking powder per pound of meat, ensuring that it
                            evenly
                            coats
                            each piece. Cover the bowl and set it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. The baking soda
                            may
                            turn
                            the meat a bright red—that’s completely normal. <br>

                            <b> 2. Cornstarch</b><br>

                            My dad has always velveted with a cornstarch slurry, a mixture of cornstarch and just enough
                            liquid
                            to turn it into a smooth paste. It should be thick enough to stick to the meat, but not so
                            thick
                            that it forms clumps.

                            Though my dad prefers soy sauce for the flavor, water or oil works just fine. Use roughly
                            two
                            tablespoons of cornstarch and one tablespoon of liquid for every pound of meat. The goal is
                            to
                            coat
                            the meat with a thin layer of cornstarch slurry without creating a thick batter.

                            After coating the meat with the slurry, refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. Then, rinse off
                            the
                            cornstarch under cold running water, removing all of it and patting it dry before cooking.
                            <br>

                        <h4>Tips For Velveting</h4>
                        <p><b>Don't let it sit too long: </b>Velvet the meat for at least five minutes or up to an hour.
                            The
                            longer it sits, the more tender it will be. However, if you velvet for longer than an hour,
                            the
                            meat
                            will become too soft—more akin to goo than a tender cut of proteins <br>

                            <b>Rinse well before cooking:</b> After velveting the meat, rinse off the baking soda or
                            slurry
                            to
                            avoid clumps in your stir-fry. Pat the meat dry after rinsing. Now it's ready for the best
                            stir-fry
                            you'll ever make at home.
